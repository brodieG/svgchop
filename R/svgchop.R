#' Approximate SVG Elements With Line Segments
#'
#'  Parse SVG elements and approximate them with straight line segments.  Only a
#'  small set of SVG syntax and commands are recognized.  The parsing is done
#'  with regex so don't expect it to be robust.  The code is slow and hacky.
#'
#' This is package is experimental, lightly tested, and not intended for
#' production use.
