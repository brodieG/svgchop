#' Approximate SVG Elements With Line Segments
#'
#' Parse and convert SVG elements into line segments and supporting meta data.
#' SVG transforms and clip paths are optionally applied, and SVG presentation
#' attributes are computed from style sheets, inline styles and attributes.  The
#' SVG 1.1 specification is only loosely followed so do not expect outputs to be
#' exactly the same as in a conforming SVG rendering engine.  This package is
#' experimental and the API will likely change in future versions.  The code is
#' optimized neither for speed nor memory use.
