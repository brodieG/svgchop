# svgchop - Approximate SVG Elements With Line Segments

## Overview

Parse and convert SVG elements into line segments and supporting meta data.  A
significant but incomplete portion of the SVG 1.1 spec is implemented in an
approximate manner.  While you should not expect the results to be identical to
those produced by a conforming implementation, many SVGs are approximated
closely.

This package is aimed at anyone who wants to extract SVG elements as polygons
before they are drawn to the canvas.  It is experimental, and follows the old
city design model (start with the village well, add features as needed, next
thing you know you have mess and you do a half-hearted [_Haussmannization_][2]).
The API is likely to change with no concessions to backward compatibility.   The
code has not been optimized.  It will not make it onto CRAN except in the
unlikely event there is substantial external interest for that to happen.

## Installation



## Feature Coverage

We implement:

* All basic elements.
* Paths, including all sub-commands.
* Transforms.
* Clipping.
* CSS and in-line styling.
* Gradients[^gradients].

The implementation does not conform to the standard, but it works reasonably
well across a wide variety of SVGs:

<a href=extra/gallery.png style='text-decoration: none; color: inherit;'>
<img
  src=extra/gallery.png style='width: 650px;' 
  alt="diptychs comparing SVGs to their svgchop counterparts"
>
</a>

Each diptych has a browser-rendered image on the left, and an `svgchop`
rendering on the right.  We purposefully use low-resolution approximations here
for effect, but it is reasonably cheap to increase the resolution sufficiently
that the `svgchop` images become difficult to distinguish from the real ones.

`svgchop` implements a `plot` method which we used for the diptychs above, but
its primary purpose is to verify `svgchop` is working correctly.  It also
provides a blueprint for others looking to access the `svgchop` data for their
own purposes and display devices.  The plot method does not implement gradients,
which is why some of the more complex SVGs don't look right.  It would be
reasonably straightforward to use the [new `grid` > 4.0.x][1] features to
display the gradients correctly, but the point of this package is to extract the
SVG data, not to compete with the browsers in rasterizing them.

[^gradients]: Gradients are fully parsed and the data required to render them is
  made available to the user.  The built-in plot method reduces them to a single
  color, but the user is free to use better display devices (e.g. `grid` > 4.0)
  that natively support gradients to render them.
