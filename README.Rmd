# svgchop - Approximate SVG Elements With Line Segments

## Overview

Parse SVG elements and approximate them with straight line segments.  Only a
small set of SVG syntax and commands are recognized.  The parsing is done with
regex so don't expect it to be robust.  The code is slow and hacky.

This is package is experimental, lightly tested, and not intended for production
use.
