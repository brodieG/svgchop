<svg viewBox="0 0 30 10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
     xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
  <circle id="myCircle" cx="5" cy="5" r="4" stroke="blue"/>
  <use xlink:href="#myCircle" x="10" fill="blue"/>
  <use xlink:href="#myCircle" x="20" fill="white" stroke="red"/>
  <!--
stroke="red" will be ignored here, as stroke was already set on myCircle. 
Most attributes (except for x, y, width, height and (xlink:)href)
do not override those set in the ancestor.
That's why the circles have different x positions, but the same stroke value.
