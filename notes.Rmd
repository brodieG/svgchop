## ToDo

* Separate parsing SVG from parsing an HTML file so we may deal with the
  multi-SVG in an HTML page more gracefully.

## Recursive Travel

* Start at svg element
* Get children
* If 'g':
    * Append transform to existing
    * Append class to existing record classes
* If 'path/rect/poly' etc:
    * Append transform to exiting
    * Append class to existing
    * Convert coords fully to line segments
    * Apply transforms

Do we keep the list structure?  It's most useful for computing final style,
transform, whatever, so if for each element we can recover all that information
we don't have to worry about keeping the full list structure.

So essentially apply everything recursively, including transforms, maybe
clip-paths, record, classes, etc.  At the end flatten everything to a list
containing coords.

Do we apply clip paths?  Package [polyclip][4] may help with this.  Let's hold
off for now and maybe only do an ad-hoc clip as it looks like properly
implementing this will be pretty rough.

## Arcs

[Mortoray post][1] on computing the center from the SVG parameters seems like a
useful starting point.  He also links to the full [FUSE implementation][2] to
BÃ©zier curves but that looks like it might be challenging to port without
understanding the semantics of that program (e.g. `EllipticArcToBezierCurve`
shows up twice with different signatures in the same class).

Rather than beziers we can just draw segments connecting projections onto the
ellipse at regular angles, though we'll have to solve the intersection of the
ellipse with the spokes?  No, if we know rx and ry (which we will?) then we can
just use the cos/sin business to draw the ellipses.  Rotation around the x axis
remains to be accounted for.

Mortoray uses the [SVG appendix][3].  Unfortunately the latter appears to have
lost all it's images.

## d.theta

Main issue right now is we're not getting the right sweep angle.  As best we can
tell the computations in 6.5.6 are causing us to go from the small arc in
reverse to the big arc by subtracting the 360 degrees, when really what we want
to do is change the direction we draw in.  The calculations are likely to return
the small arc for the angle difference between `c->p1` and `c->p2`, so we should
use the small/big flag in conjunction with the direction to figure out what to
draw.

Something is getting mixed up along the way.  Hard to believe the formulas are
wrong, but our use of the angles we get out must be wrong in some way.

Need to see if there are more implementation notes, in particular how to
interpret d.theta.
