\title{Convert SVG Path to More Usable format}
\usage{
parse_path(x, steps = 5)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a list representing a single SVG "path", which each element of the
list a property of the path.  The "d" property will be a list of "subpath"
S3 objects.}

\item{steps}{positive integer(1), how many line segments to use per radian of
arc when converting arcs to line segments.}
}
\value{
a list with as many elements as there are sub-paths in the path "d"
property.  Each element is a "subpath" S3 object containing the path
commands and coordinates in a data frame, and all other path properties as
strings
}
\description{
For polygons there is only ever one sub-path.  This also converts arcs to
line segments.  BÃ©zier curves are converted in the interpolation step later.
That interpolation happens both at parse and interpolation time is a design
flaw that originates from late addition of arc parsing.
